# Installing Bonjour on Windows

Windows users need to install the "Bonjour" service software separately. This service is mainly used for device broadcasting and discovery, and it is already built into other platform systems without the need for additional installation. If you find that devices cannot be discovered, this component may be missing.

You can install the related services by installing "Bonjour Print Services for Windows".

## Using WinGet to install

```bash
winget install --id=Apple.Bonjour  -e
```

## Download from the official website

You can also download the installation package from the Apple support official website.
