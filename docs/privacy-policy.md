## Data Synchronization and Permissions

Our application provides cross-device synchronization functionality, which includes the synchronization of various content types between your devices (such as between your phone and computer). For this functionality:

1. **SMS Data Collection and Usage**:
   * When you enable SMS synchronization, our app may request permission to access and read SMS messages on your device.
   * This data is only used for the core functionality of cross-device synchronization and is not used for any other purposes.
   * SMS data is only transferred between your own authorized devices through end-to-end encrypted channels.
   * We do not store your SMS content on our servers. All synchronization happens directly between your devices or through your personal cloud storage (if you enable cloud synchronization).
   * SMS data is only processed when you actively initiate a synchronization.

2. **Clipboard Data Collection and Usage**:
   * When you enable clipboard synchronization, our app may access clipboard content on your device.
   * This data is only used to synchronize your clipboard content between your own devices.
   * Clipboard data is only transferred between your authorized devices through end-to-end encrypted channels.
   * We do not store your clipboard content on our servers unless you choose to use cloud synchronization.
   * Clipboard data is only processed when you actively initiate a synchronization or when you copy content to your clipboard with auto-sync enabled.

3. **Screenshot Collection and Usage**:
   * When you enable screenshot synchronization, our app may request permission to access screenshots on your device.
   * These screenshots are only used for synchronization between your own devices.
   * Screenshot data is only transferred between your authorized devices through end-to-end encrypted channels.
   * We do not store your screenshots on our servers unless you choose to use cloud synchronization.
   * Screenshots are only processed when you actively initiate a synchronization or when the auto-sync feature is enabled.

4. **User Control**:
   * All synchronization features (SMS, clipboard, screenshots) are entirely optional and most are disabled by default.
   * You can enable or disable each feature individually at any time through the application settings.
   * When you disable any permission, no further data of that type will be accessed or synchronized.
   * You can delete any previously synchronized data directly from the application.

5. **Data Security**:
   * For direct device-to-device synchronization, all data is secured using end-to-end encryption.
   * When using cloud synchronization:
     * If you enable the encryption option, your data will be encrypted before being uploaded to cloud storage, and no third parties, including the cloud service provider, can access the content.
     * If you do not enable encryption, your data will be stored according to the cloud service provider's security practices, and may be accessible to the cloud service provider according to their terms of service and privacy policy.
   * We strongly recommend enabling encryption when using cloud synchronization for sensitive content such as SMS messages or personal screenshots.

## Types of Data We Use and How We Use Them

* Device model;

We generate a name combined with the device model for display among nearby devices to help users quickly identify the device they want to transfer files to.
